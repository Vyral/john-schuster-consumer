Being a smaller boutique real estate team means we’re only looking to grow with smart, knowledgeable, and experienced Realtors, and we’ve hit it out of the park with our newest addition: Abby Lehman. She was kind enough to join us in today’s video to share a little information about herself.&nbsp;

**Abby got her start in the real estate business by joining her father’s real estate team 10 years ago,** and her favorite part of the job is meeting people. She loves getting to know people, connecting with them, and helping them achieve their ultimate goals. She also learned early on that it’s important to have a strong support group in this industry, and she wanted to surround herself with a network of top professionals, which is what led her to join The John Schuster Group.

As a parent, her favorite part of being a mom is seeing the world through the eyes of her five-year-old daughter, Madelin. When asked which superhero she could be, she said the ability to fly would be the best, so she opted for Wonder Woman. Can Wonder Woman fly, though? “I think she can do just about anything,” Abby says.

**Abby is excited to be here and to get started.** She’s looking forward to meeting with new people and, as mentioned above, helping them achieve their ultimate goals. If you’d like to connect with Abby or have any real estate questions, check out our website or give our office a call. We look forward to hearing from you\!
