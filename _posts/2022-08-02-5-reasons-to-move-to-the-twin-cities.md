Why do we run our business in the Twin Cities area? It’s simple: it’s an incredible place to live. If you’re considering relocating, we believe you should give the Twin Cities serious consideration, and today we’re sharing five reasons why:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp;**Minnesota is always at or near the top of best states to live in.** U.S. News and World Report ranked Minnesota as the second-best state in the whole country. Meanwhile, Money Rates looked at median wages, cost of living, income tax, unemployment rate, and workplace safety to determine their best state, and Minnesota ranked third overall. Do a Google search if you don’t believe us; Minnesota and the Twin Cities area are always near the top.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;**You can experience the fullest of each season.** Our springs are green, our summers are beautiful, our falls are golden, and our winters are full of fun activities like skiing.&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp;**The Twin Cities are affordable.** Compared to other metro areas on the east and west coasts, our cost of living is shockingly low. If you want your dollar to go farther, you might want to consider Minnesota. We’re also home to numerous Fortune 500 companies, so there are plenty of fantastic job opportunities.

&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;**There’s so much to do\!** Besides New York City, the Twin Cities have more theater seats per capita than anywhere else in the U.S. On top of that, there are plenty of culinary options for food lovers. We can’t leave out the Mall of America. It’s one of the greatest attractions in America for a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp;**The Minnesota State Fair.** It starts towards the end of August and ends around Labor Day. Each year, nearly two million people attend. If you like beer, food, or having a good time, you’ll love the fair.&nbsp;
