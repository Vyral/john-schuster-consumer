  Have you ever heard of an ISA? It stands for ‘inside sales agent.’ Unlike
  buyers agents and listing agents, they do not show or list homes. Instead,
  they work behind the scenes to help both buyers and sellers carry out their
  transactions quicker by finding leads and properties that are not yet listed
  for sale. To hear more about how ISAs help you, watch my latest video.

  Our ISAs respond within five minutes during business hours and within 15

What is an ISA, and why is it so important that you hire an agent or a team that has one?

**ISA stands for ‘inside sales agent.’** This kind of agent does not show or list homes; they strictly work on immediately getting leads for your home to agents.

Why are they so important? If you are a seller, think about it: we spend tons of money to make your listing look fabulous online. We pay thousands of dollars each month to move it to the top of all the aggregators, so when a buyer comes through and they request more information, you need to respond to that as soon as possible.

It seems like nowadays, everyone is impatient with their communication—they want a response immediately. Our ISAs respond to all online inquiries and anyone reaching out to the John Schuster Group within five minutes during business hours and within 15 minutes on nights and weekends. **That means an interested client will get into our sellers’ homes faster.**

If you’re a buyer, ISAs are also important, especially in today’s competitive market. **You need a resource on your side to find inventory that isn’t actively available on the market.** Inventory has come down by a third from where it was last year, and many buyers are losing homes in bidding wars. People who choose to work with us on the buy side will benefit from our ability to identify neighborhoods and communities they’ll want to live in. Our ISAs will call out to every home in that neighborhood in the attempt to find inventory that’s not yet available. 

If you have any questions or are thinking about buying or selling a home, please feel free to reach out to us. We would love to work with you and explain more about why our ISA program might be a benefit to you.<br>
