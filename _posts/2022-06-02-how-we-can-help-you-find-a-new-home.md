More and more, we’ve had clients reach out to us saying that they don’t want to list their homes because they feel like they won’t be able to buy another house with our record low inventory. We recognize your concern, so we’ve come up with three programs to help you find that perfect home:

**1\. Our Exclusive Look Program.** We have a database of off-market homes available exclusively for our clients. These sellers have signed a listing agreement with our brokerage, but their homes haven’t come to the market. Wouldn’t you like an opportunity to see homes before they hit the market?

**2\. A reverse contingency.** This is a wonderful program where you can list and sell your home, but that sale is contingent on finding your next house in a predetermined amount of time. It’s the best of both worlds; you know what you’ll net from your current home, and you don’t have to worry about the next one.

**3\. Buy now and sell later.** Many of our clients who qualify are choosing to buy their next home now and sell their old one later. You can find your next home before the for-sale sign goes up in your old house’s yard.

Our goal is to make the buying and selling process stress-free. Call or email us to hear all the details about each option and see if they’re right for you.&nbsp;
