Folks, 2021 has been a year for the books—**it’s been one of the hottest markets ever\!** Let’s take a look at the most recent numbers for the 13-county region:

At just over $381,000, the average sales price is up by 12.6%. We’re still facing a supply shortage, but we have felt a little pullback over the last three months as we’ve exited the spring market.

Over the last 12 months, new listings are up by 4.8%, and closed sales are up by 13.7%. We are having a difficult time adding inventory to our market, as evidenced by our 1.3-month supply, which is down 35%. Remember that a balanced market is a six-month supply.

**For sellers, proper pricing is key** since buyers have become more selective as prices have surged. Buyers, on the other hand, need to be ready to act on brand-new listings immediately, or be willing to find a seller whose house has been on the market for a few weeks because they overshot their price initially. Many times, buyers can negotiate with those sellers to get a price that is appropriate to the condition of the house.
