I recently had the pleasure of meeting with Dwayne Rogers, owner/proprietor of Angelea’s Soul Food Kitchen, to talk about how his increasingly popular restaurant honors his mother's legacy by serving the community some savory soul food delights.&nbsp;

Back in 2016 and 2017, Dwayne’s mother and sister began seriously exploring the idea of opening a restaurant. When his mom passed away, they took her dream and made it a reality. Dwayne’s sister had preserved their mother and grandmother’s beloved recipes, and, with a few added twists, presented the public with the same great eats they were raised on.&nbsp;

Today, Angelea’s Soul Food Kitchen has become a staple in the community; prior to shooting our video, we saw at least 20 people come and go\! That’s because what this establishment has to offer is simple yet amazing: “…authentic, traditional soul food created with recipes full of rich and savory flavors, passed down from our mother Angelea and served with love, tenderness and large portions.”&nbsp;

**Angelea’s three most popular items, according to Dwayne, are the jerk quarter-leg chicken, the lobster tail, and the turkey tip.** As for Dwayne’s personal favorite, he said it’s impossible for him to choose; his mother Angelea’s cooking was just *that* good.&nbsp;

Angelea's Soul Food Kitchen is open Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 8 p.m. On Sunday, they're open from noon to 5 p.m. Word-of-mouth is the No. 1 source of new business, which makes sense considering how many first-time diners are blown away from the first bite.&nbsp;
