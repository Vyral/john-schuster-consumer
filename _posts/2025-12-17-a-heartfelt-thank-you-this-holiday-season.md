  The holiday season is here, and I’m feeling all the good vibes! I’m grateful
  for all the amazing people I’ve met this year. Helping you find new spaces or
  start fresh has truly been one of the highlights of my career. You’ve made
  this journey meaningful and a whole lot of fun. From my team and me, Merry
  Christmas and Happy New Year! Here’s a festive holiday message to kick off the
  season.
