When it’s time to buy a house, it’s important to choose an agent who is well-connected and can find all the homes that meet your needs. Here at the John Schuster Group, **we offer a buyer consultation for every type of buyer**, from first-time homebuyers and move-up buyers to those needing senior services.

**We also offer investor consultations for those looking to expand their portfolios.** Agents are now required to have a buyer-showing agreement in place before they can show any home listed on the MLS. You can no longer rely on an online real estate agent to simply show up without a signed agreement. Our buyer clients get private access to Coldwell Banker’s Exclusive Look properties, which are not listed on the MLS. We also search for other non-listed properties to give you more options.

When you hire an agent, you want someone who will work for you. Whether we meet in person, at one of our 11 metro-area offices, or virtually in your home, we guide you through every step of the process from start to finish.

The agent you choose matters. At the John Schuster Group, we bring over 500 five-star Google reviews and more than 150 years of collective experience in Twin Cities real estate. We’re committed to providing expert guidance and support at every step. If you have questions or need guidance, just reach out. You can call me at [**952-222-9000**](tel:9522229000 "952-222-9000"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or send an email to [**john@johnschustergroup.com**](mailto:john@johnschustergroup.com). I look forward to hearing from you.
