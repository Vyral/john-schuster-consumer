For our very first community spotlight video, we’re visiting the restaurant&nbsp;[Pizza Karma](https://pizzakarma.com/){: target="_blank"} and talking with the owner/head chef [Raghavan Iyer](http://www.raghavaniyer.com){: target="_blank"} about what makes this establishment so unique.&nbsp;

In Raghavan’s words, a pizza is defined by its cooking style, and **Pizza Karma’s cooking method utilizes clay ovens to hone their signature tandoor-style crust**—a style used in 80% of the rest of the world. The temperatures of these clay ovens reach as high as 600&deg;F.&nbsp;

Aside from making great pizza, Pizza Karma goes out of their way to give back to the community. Every Sunday, for instance, **they donate a portion of their total sales volume to their designated charity of the month.&nbsp;**

“The word ‘karma’ really signifies what our philosophy is all about,” Raghavan says. “You do good, you’re going to get back good. It’s always nice to be kind to your neighbors and people that are in need.”

In addition to being a pizza maestro/business entrepreneur, Raghavan is also a published author and Emmy winner. His brand, he says, is education, so everything he does hinges on teaching people something. In fact, Epicurious just named him as one of the all-time top 100 influencers for home cooks, and he’s in good company—Julia Child and James Beard are on the same list.&nbsp;

If you live in Eden Prairie or the surrounding suburbs, we highly recommend you stop by Pizza Karma. If you know of any businesses we should spotlight in the near future or you have any real estate questions at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.&nbsp; We'd love to hear from you.&nbsp;
