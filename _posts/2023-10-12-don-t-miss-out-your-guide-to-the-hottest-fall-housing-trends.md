It’s time for a quick market update, where we'll delve into the critical trends of the fall housing market in 2023.

First and foremost, 2023 continues to be a seller's market. Closed sales have declined by 25.4% over the last rolling 12 months. Although interest rates have risen to the mid-7% range, there's a reassuring trend of steady growth—the average sale price in the 13-county metro area has surged by over 3.9% in the past 12 months. **This makes Minnesota an excellent place to be a homeowner, and the Twin Cities continue to exhibit strength.** Buyers are anxiously anticipating new inventory to hit the market.
