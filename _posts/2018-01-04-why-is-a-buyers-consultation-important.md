Why is a buyer’s consultation with a real estate agent important?

We love to meet with all of our buyers before we begin their home search. We sit down with them and walk them through the whole process, from starting your search to finding a home to all of the steps it takes to get to the closing table.

**We believe that it’s important to give buyers like you a full market exposure.**That way, you know what is going on in the price point you are interested in buying in. In certain price points, homes sell quickly with multiple offers. In other price points, buyers can negotiate more aggressively and get a great deal.

Some buyers go to Zillow or Realtor.com, see a house they like, and request a showing. Then, they get assigned to an agent and buy the first house that they see.

Since these buyers skipped the consultation step, they really don’t know what they’ve missed. Other homes on the market might have been a better fit for them, or they may not have gotten the best deal.

If you can hit pause for a second and sit down for a full market exposure, **you have a better chance of finding the home you truly want and getting a better deal.**

If you want to buy a home in a specific neighborhood and can’t find one because of a lack of inventory, we can help. Just tell us you are interested in that area during the consultation, and our team will canvas the neighborhood. We will call every home in the area and find inventory that’s not yet on the market and that other buyers won’t have a chance to look at.

We are also good at getting our buyers in front of a lender sooner rather than later. If there should happen to be an issue on your credit report, you can get that fixed in three to six months. If you know that information, then you get get a better interest rate and increase your purchasing power.

**We will also walk through your negotiation strategy.** If you are interested in foreclosed homes, distressed properties, or you’re an owner-occupant buyer, there will be different strategies depending on the type of home you are looking at. There will also be different strategies for each price point. Knowing that information empowers you to make a better decision.

During the buyer’s consultation, we cover other important aspects of the home buying process, such as home warranties and closing dates. That way, you’ll know which items you’ll want to negotiate when you are putting in a purchase agreement.

If you have a home to sell, a buyer’s consultation can be very helpful. We can help you figure out if you want to sell your home first and be a noncontingent buyer, or we can help put together a strategy for making your offer contingent on the sale of your current home.

**Finally, it’s really important that you feel comfortable when hiring your buyer’s agent.** You are the boss. You want to hire someone you feel comfortable with and that cares about your purchase decision.

A half-hour consultation with a buyer’s agent will empower you with the information you need to make a great purchase decision. Everyone here at our group loves working with buyers, so we would be happy to sit down with you and listen to your wants and needs so we can help you find the perfect home for your family.

If you have any questions about the home buying process or would like to schedule a buyer’s consultation, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
