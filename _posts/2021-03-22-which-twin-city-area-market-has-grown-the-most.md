Are you sensing the trend? We’re seeing major growth past the third-ring suburbs as people are looking for more house for their money, more space, and affordable housing. We have a shortage of inventory in all areas and price points. So if you’re thinking of selling your home, you might be very surprised to see what your home could sell for in today’s market.

**If you’re a buyer, you’ll have to be fully pre-approved and underwritten with a reputable lender.** You’ll also have to be ready to make split-second decisions, and you should anticipate competing with five, 10, or even more other buyers for that house.

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home in this market, don’t hesitate to reach out to the John Schuster Group. We’ll be glad to help you out.
