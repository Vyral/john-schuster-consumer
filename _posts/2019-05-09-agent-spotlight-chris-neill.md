Chris Neill has been with the John Schuster Group for four years, and it’s been absolutely fabulous. He recently moved to Minnetonka with his family, but there are some other things about Chris that you may not know. For example, as a former sous-chef of 10 years, he loves to cook, eat, and visit great restaurants. He’s also a huge baseball fan.

**But what is it that ultimately got Chris into real estate?**

Chris has always been interested in architecture and design. He started on a business venture in that vein, but it didn’t end up panning out. That, in turn, shifted his interest to the commercial and residential markets.&nbsp;

Chris is a rockstar on our team who’s sold hundreds of homes with us. With the market shift we’ve noticed, what does Chris’ expertise tell him about our market currently?

In his experience, **homes under the $300,000 price point are moving off the market quickly, leaving our inventory pretty light.** A lot of his listings have seen multiple offers, and the shift seems to be marketwide. Even markets above the $800,000 price point are moving fairly quickly, which has been a bit of a change from the past several years.&nbsp;

Another fun fact about Chris: He is a master of zen. Last year, there was a huge packet of deals that he was about to take on, and he and John made a bet. If he closed those deals, John would sit through an entire hot yoga session. Well, he closed those deals, so John delivered on the bet. Who knew hot yoga could be so hot\!?

Ultimately, John is honored to have Chris on the team. He’s truly a great guy to be around.
