Are you thinking of selling your home next year? Are you planning on spending this coming fall and winter getting your home ready for the spring 2021 market? If so, then **there’s something you need to take care of right now: green photos.&nbsp;**

Green photos are the awesome shots we’ll take of the exterior of your home while it’s still bright, green, and beautiful outside. We want to showcase your lovely landscaping, the gardens you love, and your outstanding outdoor spaces.&nbsp;

We don’t want your home to show with loads of Minnesota snow covering up, we want it to shine in our great summer weather. So, **if you’re planning to sell in 2021 and are interested in having green photos taken in the next month, reach out to the John Schuster Group today**. You can log onto our [website](https://www.johnschustergroup.com/), or you can give us a call or email.&nbsp;
