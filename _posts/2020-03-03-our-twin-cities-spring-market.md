This is one of our favorite times of the year—we’ve begun our spring market\! It’s a great time to sell your home for top dollar in Minnesota. Today we’re sharing a quick spring market update. 2019 was a record year, so if you’re a buyer entering this market, you have to be fully pre-approved, underwritten, and be ready to jump on a house as soon as it hits the market. Buyers: Brace yourselves for a very competitive market this spring.

**Here are a few current market statistics:**

* Inventory is down 19.6%
* MLS-wide we had 59,843 closed transactions last year&nbsp;
* Sellers received on average 98.8% of the list price in 2019
* Average days on market is 49
* The average sale price increased by 5.1% last year

If you’re thinking of selling in 2020, you truly want to take advantage of our spring market while it’s still a seller’s market. Also, we offer a program that can get almost any property ready for sale in one month or less. Let us know if you want to take advantage of that.&nbsp;
