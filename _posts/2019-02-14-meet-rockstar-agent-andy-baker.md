I’m very excited to be able to introduce you to one of our rockstar agents, Andy Baker. Andy has been selling real estate for 16 years, pretty much since I developed the team all those years ago. To Andy, it just made sense for us to work together, and things have been great for us both.&nbsp;

**Andy has always been an outdoors kind of guy, and he loves any activity that allows him to go outside and enjoy the weather.** He takes his wife and two children on ski trips during the weekends in the winter. In fact, in a couple weeks, Andy will be traveling to Breckenridge with his kids for the first time to go skiing out in the mountains. During the summer, he enjoys fishing, surfing, and boating.

He knew that he always wanted to be in sales, so he decided, “Why not sell homes? Everybody needs one.” He finds excitement in helping families realize their dream of finding a new home so they can start a new chapter in their lives.

Like I said, Andy is a rockstar agent—last year, he personally sold over 90 homes. **When clients work with him, they can expect:**

* **Open, honest, and direct communication**
* **Great follow-up on feedback**
* **Timely replies to calls**
* **To get their home sold**

Andy is on pace to match, if not succeed, his sales last year, and we truly value him as a member of our team.

If you have any questions about buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’ve got excellent agents who would be happy to take care of you.
