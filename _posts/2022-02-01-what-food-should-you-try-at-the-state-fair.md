We are a little over six months away from the next great Minnesota get-together: the 2022 State Fair. Last year, we sent our resident state fair expert and Realtor extraordinaire, Tim Sabin, to try some of the worst and best foods at the 2021 fair. Let’s see how it went.

**The Peg** is one of the best secrets in town. It’s been here for over 30 years, but they have amazing food. Tim tried the Peg Muffin, which was phenomenal. You have to go there for breakfast.&nbsp;

There are a few different spots to get cheese curds at the fair, but **The Mouth Trap** is by far the best. He gave it a 10 out of 10.

At **Bayou Bob’s**, Tim tried something new: alligator on a stick, specifically the habanero cheddar flavor. He couldn’t say he liked it, though. The bite was good, but it was quite spicy.

Tim tried another new dish at **The Hanger** called the Island Hopper. It’s half a pineapple filled with chicken, rice, and a bunch of other good stuff. It was very good.<br>&nbsp;

Next up was the **Scotch Eggs** down by the animal buildings. He got a hardboiled egg with sriracha and horseradish. It might not sound amazing, but the sauces went together well.

**Giggle’s** on Machinery Hill is one of our absolute favorite places to go at the fair. This year, Tim tried the walleye cake, which is essentially like crab cakes. He doesn’t feel that the hype for this dish is deserved .

Finally, Tim stopped by the famous **Sweet Martha’s Cookies.** If you haven’t tried it before, you can grab some of the cookies and head down to the all-you-can-drink milk next to the poultry building and Miracle of Birth Center. What a great way to end the day.

Our hands-down favorite item was the cheese curds from The Mouth Trap. There’s nothing else like them. One thing to watch out for is that alligator on a stick. We can’t wait for the fair this year, and we hope to see you there\!
