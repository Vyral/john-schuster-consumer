Last year was one of our busiest years ever, and we knew it was time to grow. We want to make sure every one of our clients is working with the best of the best, so we only hire experienced real estate agents who have a great track record and strong ethics. So we’re excited to announce our newest team member: Steve Varhol\! Here’s our question and answer session so you can get to know him better:

**Tell us about yourself.**

I am a \#GirlDad; I have two daughters, a 15-year-old and a 19-year-old. My oldest is currently in the National Guard, and my youngest is active in volleyball and fast-pitch softball. I play the role of “Uber dad” when I’m not working.

**What got you into real estate?**

I’d been in sales for a long time. Customer service is crucial to me, and when I bought my house, I did not have a great experience. The agent wasn’t attentive, didn’t listen well, was pushy, and didn’t answer my questions. I felt like I could do a much better job as a Realtor—not in a cocky way, just that I could serve clients better than that. That experience is what made me start to explore the option of entering real estate.&nbsp;

**What is your favorite part of working in real estate?**

Meeting new people and building relationships. You get to meet so many different people, and I have several friendships due to working in real estate for the past six years, which is the cherry on top of my career.

**Why did you join The John Schuster Group?**

The level of experience and professionalism here is second to none when compared to my experience of working with other real estate teams. Also, the camaraderie and teamwork components of this team were a huge draw.

**What’s your favorite part of being a dad?**

Trying to answer girl questions. As a guy, I don’t always do the same things as they do, so when my daughters have questions about girl stuff, I do some research and try my best to answer them. I have an awkward Google search history.&nbsp;

**What is something no one knows about you?**

I’m related to the painter Andy Warhol. However, I don’t have any paintings or inheritance from him.

**What are three words that describe you?**

Passionate, caring, and tenacious.&nbsp;
