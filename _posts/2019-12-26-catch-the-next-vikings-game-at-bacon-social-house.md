We’re continuing our Community Spotlight series today at Bacon Social House. If you’re in downtown Minneapolis you have to check out this place. **It’s just a stone’s throw from U.S. Bank Stadium and they specialize in everyone’s favorite food, bacon.**

Bacon Social House is a Colorado-based company, and this restaurant is their third (and their first outside of Colorado). It’s a sea of purple on game day, especially for the Costa Rican Benedict and bacon tots.&nbsp;

They also have many different kinds of bacon, which were sampled in the video above. We tried the barbecue bacon, habanero bacon, and chipotle ranch bacon. They were incredible.
