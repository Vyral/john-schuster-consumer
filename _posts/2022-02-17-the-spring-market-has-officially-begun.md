We have a real estate market alert\! Now that the Super Bowl is in the books, **the spring market has officially started,** and it’s truly one of the best times of year to sell your Twin Cities home. All the market fundamentals have started to come together. Buyer demand has stayed strong despite rising interest rates, and more and more sellers are bringing their homes to the market as they continue to sit in the driver’s seat.

Our spring market runs from now through early June. We have so many buyers waiting for a home right now that we can get you premium offers without having to make updates and repairs that you would have had to do in past markets.&nbsp;

When all the pieces come together, we’re able to sell so many of our listings. **Many times, we earn our sellers tens of thousands over their list prices**. Last year, our listings sold for an average of 103% of their list prices. Your home could be worth tens of thousands more than you think based on its condition and location. Reach out today for a free, no-obligation market analysis of your home to learn more.

If you have any other questions or real estate needs we can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
