We’ve got an important message for all of you today: We need your help!

The John Schuster Group has more leads than we can handle, and we need hardworking real estate professionals to help us share the load.&nbsp;

If you’re a people person, love closing deals, and feel like you could thrive in an environment where you’re receiving 15 to 20 leads per month, then **it’s time for you to think about joining our team.&nbsp;**

The John Schuster Group was built with our agents in mind. We’ve got two inside sales agents to help qualify and nurture every single lead so that you can do what you do best: Meeting new people, signing contracts, and negotiating deals.&nbsp;

We’ve also got a stager on staff and work with some of the Twin Cities’ best architectural photographers because we believe in the power of having a strong network.&nbsp;

In addition to this, we’ve got all relevant systems mastered. **This allows us to ensure that our agents are able to have the kind of work/life balance most Realtors can only dream of.&nbsp;**

We have been endorsed on a local level by WCCO radio hosts Paul Douglas, Jordana Green, and David Lee, on the KQRS Morning Show by sportscaster Michele Tafoya, and on 102.9 The Wolf. We’ve been recognized nationally, as well—having been endorsed by “Shark Tank” host and real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran.

This drives massive demand to our team, meaning that we need agents who can provide the exceptional service our clients expect and deserve.&nbsp;

In 2018, we sold an average of one home each day and achieved more than $100 million in sales volume. Even after all that success, we’re still looking forward. We want to grow even more in 2019, and we want you with us when we do.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking of making a change, are ready to grow your business, and are excited about working in a fun, collaborative atmosphere, then **please [fill out this form](http://www.johnschustergroup.com/join-our-team.php){: target="_blank"} so we can meet and discuss your future.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
