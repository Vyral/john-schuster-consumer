As a homeowner in Minnesota, you’ve probably received your annual property valuation notice from your local assessor. This notice is important because your property taxes are directly tied to the value the assessor places on your home.

Once you get the notice, it’s crucial to note that you have a limited amount of time to protest the new valuation if you believe it’s incorrect. Be sure to pay attention to all the important dates listed on the notice.

**If you want to protest the value the government has assessed on your property, now is the time to act.** A good first step is to look at various online automatic valuation models, like the one on our website at [JohnSchusterGroup.com.](http://johnschustergroup.com) You can enter your address and get an estimate in 30 seconds or less.

If you prefer a more detailed approach, we’re more than happy to create a custom, confidential market analysis for you. We can even meet you at your property to go over everything. You can call me at **952-222-9000** or send an email to **john@johnschustergroup.com.** I look forward to hearing from you.
