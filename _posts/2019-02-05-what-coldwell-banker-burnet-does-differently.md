I’ve been with Coldwell Banker Burnet for my entire real estate career, and today I want to explain why.

This brokerage has been a leader in real estate marketing in Minnesota and, really, nationwide. **We make it our priority to give our sellers the best possible market coverage, and our efforts have absolutely paid off.** 138 million people viewed Coldwell Banker listings online last year.

This massive success is partially due to Coldwell Banker’s incredible technology platform—which is, hands down, the best in the business.

Of course, resources like this can’t sustain our success on their own. Our amazing leadership team also plays a huge part. In my opinion, **w****e’ve got the best leadership across the entire Twin Cities area.** Coldwell Banker Burnet’s president, Matt Baker, has been with the brokerage for over 35 years. He has not only served as a strong leader for Coldwell Banker Burnet in general, but he has also been a phenomenal personal mentor for me. He has helped shaped the John Schuster Group into what it is today.

With all of that said, it’s important for sellers to realize that not all brokerages are equal. We at Coldwell Banker Burnet have the highest average sales price of any brokerage in the area. Our sellers achieve an average sale price that is 23% higher than that of the average area broker.

When it comes time to sell, it’s important that you choose a team with the best marketing resources, the highest level of experience, and the greatest breadth of knowledge. And **that is exactly what we at Coldwell Banker Burnet can offer you.**
