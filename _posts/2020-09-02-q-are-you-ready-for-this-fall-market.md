We have some very important information to share with you today. Do you know that the date on which you choose to list your home for sale can truly make you thousands more on your sale if done right?

You’ve heard of our hot spring market before, which usually happens from January through June. However, **we’re about to enter a pretty unique fall market,** which starts after Labor Day and runs through October. This is a fantastic moment in time to sell your home.

2020 has not been a normal year by any standards, but over the last few months, we’ve seen an increase in home prices and a surge in buyer activity. We’re in our ninth year of aggressive price appreciation in real estate, and because markets are cyclical, it can’t last forever.

If you’ve been thinking about selling your home, even a little bit, we highly recommend that you **reach out to a professional who can give you a market analysis for your home.** When all the pieces come together, we can generate multiple offer situations for our clients. List and sell now while we’re still in a seller’s market.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
