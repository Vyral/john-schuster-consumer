This has been a bizarre year for almost everything, and that includes the real estate world. Many homes are selling with multiple bids, and **buyers can truly get discouraged in this hot housing market.** If you’re one of those buyers, don’t be dismayed\! The great news is that one of the best times of year to be a buyer is just right around the corner.&nbsp;

In a seller’s market, the winter months are an excellent time to buy a house, and there are a few reasons why. First, most buyers purchase properties from spring to early autumn, so there’s less competition in the wintertime. All those other buyers either found a home or got disheartened and put their plans off until next spring.&nbsp;

Also, **heading into the holidays, houses generate fewer showings, which means there will be fewer multiple-offer situations.** This gives you a higher chance of getting your offer accepted. Additionally, some of the inventory starts aging; some sellers *need* to sell, and in some cases, that’s because they overpriced their properties during the summer. In the winter they may be ready to look at more realistic pricing and negotiate with buyers.

If you’re going to buy in this market, you need to be pre-approved with a fantastic local lender and partner with a trusted real estate agent.
