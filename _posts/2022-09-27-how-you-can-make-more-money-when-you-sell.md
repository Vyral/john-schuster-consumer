Are you thinking of selling your home next year? If so, we have a six-month game plan. **You can act now and make more money while making the process easier for you.**

Did you know that our spring market is one of the best times to list and sell your home? Our spring market starts in mid-February, and it runs through early June. It is one of the best times to sell your home in the Twin Cities, but it doesn't always look so great outdoors in the late winter and early spring. You want to get green exterior photos of your yard in the next couple of weeks before the snow starts falling.

When we market your home, we want to showcase your beautiful outdoor spaces you love so much. It's important that we meet with you soon, so we can have our professional photographers get those great exterior photos of your home. When we step out to meet with you, we'll help customize a detailed game plan tailored to your needs.

We have a professional stager on our staff, and we include a staging consultation with all of our listings. The great part about starting this process now is you will have six-plus months to get your home in the best showing condition possible. Again, we don't necessarily want you doing tens of thousands of dollars in updates, but many times there are easy and inexpensive updates you can do that will net you thousands more in your home sale.

Also, we want to note that selling as is is a better approach for some sellers and their circumstances. We ended up selling around a fourth of our properties with this strategy. For everyone that reaches out to us in the next two weeks, we will include with your listing free exterior photos, a professional staging consultation, and the best yet—we'll give you a detailed game plan so you know what to expect every step of the way.

**When you reach out to us for a confidential assessment of your home, there is no obligation.** We just want to guide you through the process. Should plans change, we also include an easy-exit listing guarantee. You can cancel your listing any time before you sign a purchase agreement with no cost or liability to you. In addition, for everyone that reaches out today, we'll bill you our 40-page home marketing guide.
