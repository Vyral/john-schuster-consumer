If you plan to sell your home in 2026, now is the time to act. The spring market starts in mid-February and runs through May. That is when homes sell fastest and often for the most money. But during those months, lawns and outdoor spaces usually don’t look their best.

That’s why **I’m offering free professional exterior green photos for all 2026 listings.** There’s no upfront cost and no long-term commitment. You can have your home photographed while the yard is still green, and use those photos to attract more buyers when it hits the market next year.

I also offer a six-month plan to help you get your interior ready in time. This gives you a clear checklist to work on now so you don’t feel rushed later.

To get started, go to [**JohnSchusterGroup.com**](http://johnschustergroup.com) or call or text [**<u>952-222-9000</u>**](tel:9522229000 "952-222-9000"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Let’s get your home ready to sell.
