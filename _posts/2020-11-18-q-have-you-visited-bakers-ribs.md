Today we’re at one of the best barbeque restaurants in the Twin Cities: Baker’s Ribs in Eden Prairie. I had the pleasure of speaking with Al Killian, the proprietor of this great establishment, and in full disclosure, we’re very good friends. I even helped open Baker’s Ribs back in 1993\!

Al says the secret to excellent barbeque is cooking with oak wood smoke. When you walk in here, you smell that fantastic campfire scent, and the food is absolutely delicious. Some of the best-selling items are the ribs, pork, and brisket. I can confirm that the ribs here are choice—they have a delicious dry rub. A few other items on the menu include fried pies, turkey breast, chicken breast, beef sandwich, and more.
