The Twin Cities real estate spring market is about to start and it’s truly the best time of the year to sell your home. Because of this, we’re holding some more Home Seller Forums this month that will once again be hosted by Paul Douglas.

When you show up, you’ll learn everything you need to know to make thousands more on your home sale. **We'll share our marketing secrets and give you tips on actions you can complete now to get a higher price.**

Our last forum sold out and we wanted to be sure that you can claim your ticket. Each event lasts about an hour, and we’ll provide you with all the necessary information to be fully informed and have a detailed game plan for your home sale.&nbsp;

**So join us on Wednesday, January 22, at the Maple Grove Community Center or Thursday, January 23, at Braemar Golf Course in Edina.** Each day will have two sessions, with one starting at 11:00 a.m. and the other starting at 6:45 p.m.

Three out of the last four forums have sold out, so make sure that you reserve your seats here today.

If you have any other questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
