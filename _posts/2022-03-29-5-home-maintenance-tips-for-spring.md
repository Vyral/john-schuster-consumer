It’s officially spring\! As the Minnesota winter thaws out, you have a great opportunity to maintain the outsides of your home. That’s why today we want to share five home-maintenance tips to help get your house ready for spring:

**1\. Inspect the gutters and downspouts.** Ensure that any leaves left from last fall are removed and that your downspout extensions are directed at least 10 feet away from your home. Most water intrusion comes from clogged gutters and downspout problems, so addressing these issues can prevent further problems down the road.&nbsp;

**2\. Prepare your air conditioner.** Remove any leaves or other debris that have accumulated on your outside condenser. Also, contact a trusted HVAC company to do a tune-up on your system. As a note, many of these companies are booked for weeks or months in advance, so the sooner you schedule your appointment, the better.

**3\. Inspect your exterior siding and windows.** If your property sustained any siding or window damage over the winter, now is the time to address it. Check for wood rot, and cut back any trees that are getting too close to your home.&nbsp;

**4\. Check the window screens and doors.** If you’ve taken your screens off for the winter, now is the time to put them back on. This is also a great time to fix any tears in them, which can easily be repaired with kits sold online or at your local hardware store.

**5\. Take steps to prepare your lawn for summer.** Clear away any remaining leaves from your lawn and use a weed-and-feed fertilizer before weeds take over your yard. Finally, you should have your lawn aerated every other year. By poking strategic holes in your yard, vital nutrients can reach your plants’ root systems, giving you the greenest yard possible.&nbsp;
