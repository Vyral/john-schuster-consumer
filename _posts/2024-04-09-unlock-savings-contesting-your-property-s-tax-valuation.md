It's that pivotal time of year for homeowners in the Twin Cities: notifications from local counties about new tax-assessed values are arriving. With the steady rise in home prices across the area, it's no surprise that property taxes for many homeowners are on the upswing as well. However, are you aware that Minnesota law requires assessors to estimate the market value of land and buildings? **This market value is determined based on the likely selling price in an arm's length transaction within an open and competitive market.**

Assessors set these property values annually as of January 2nd. But the question arises: Is your property's assessed valuation accurate? Homeowners often have just a few weeks to challenge their tax-assessed values, and understanding your rights and options is crucial.
