Meteorologist Paul Douglas joins us today to share a prediction he can make with nearly 100% certainty: If you’re selling your home within the next two years and you attend The John Schuster Group’s upcoming home seller forum, **you’ll make more money from your sale and learn everything you need to know to prepare your home for the market.** You’ll also receive a roadmap with everything needed to make the process as easy as possible. We have lots of fun in our forums, and we’re excited to be hosting another virtual seller forum soon.

Dozens of sellers attended last year’s virtual forum, and some sold their homes for over $55,000 over the asking price. We love these success stories and testimonials from our clients, and we’ve heard plenty of them from forum attendees. We’ll give you all our marketing secrets and explain the actions you can take when selling. If you attend, John will send you a copy of his 40-page home marketing guide. The forum lasts a little less than an hour, and you’ll leave it fully informed with a detailed game plan for selling your home.
