This is a very special time that happens every year in the Twin Cities real estate market — it’s the official start of the spring real estate market throughout the Greater Minneapolis and Saint Paul metro area.

Now, some of you might be saying, “Are you absolutely crazy? There's snow on the ground.” Paul Douglas is predicting a snowstorm next week, but some of the seasons move quickly in the North Star State. **The Twin Cities spring real estate market starts just after the Super Bowl** in mid-February, and it runs through early July. If you wait to list your home until summer, you just might be too late.

We historically see a big slowdown the week before the 4th of July, and many times, we don't see a pickup until the end of August. Buyer activity surges during the spring market, and if you're selling in 2023, you do not want to miss out on this opportunity. Don't be fooled by some of the media reports. There is still high buyer demand for well-maintained, turnkey homes. You might be surprised to see what your home could sell for in this spring market.
