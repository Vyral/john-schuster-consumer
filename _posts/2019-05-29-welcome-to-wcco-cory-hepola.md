Former KARE-TV anchor Cory Hepola has made the switch to WCCO Radio. Cory has been a long-time fan of our team at the John Schuster Group, and we’re just as excited about this move as he is. Cory, like us, is passionate about bringing informative, educational, and inspiring content to our community, and he’s definitely delivered on that front in his new role. Of course, Cory isn’t the only one with exciting news. Our own team has something great to share, too. As of this year, the John Schuster Group was named one of the top 10 Coldwell Banker brokerages worldwide. We’re very proud of this accomplishment, but it wouldn’t have been possible without the support of people like you and the endorsement of people like Cory. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
