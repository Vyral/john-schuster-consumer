I’ve got a quick question for you: Does your home look like an HGTV episode of “Hoarders”? If it’s not that bad, do you still have a bunch of extra stuff lying around and feel like it’s time to declutter? Well, I’ve got five great tips to help you declutter your home today. Let’s get started!

**1\. You’ve got to have a game plan.** This should include a vision of what you want your home to look like when you’re done decluttering and a timeline to complete the project. Knowing your end goal and having a schedule will keep you motivated and on track.

**2\. Clear the area you want to declutter.** Sort everything into categories. Return items that are out of place to their proper areas in your home and decide what you want to keep in each pile. This will help you see what you’re working with and make the process more manageable.

**3\. Decide what to discard.** Be ruthless. Immediately place items you no longer need in the trash and get them out of your house. Holding onto things “just in case” often leads to unnecessary clutter.

**4\. Donate the other items.** Decide what you want to donate and place these items in a donation bag or box. And then, never look back. Knowing your items are going to someone in need can make parting with them easier.

**5\. Repeat.** Set realistic goals and tackle one room or area at a time. Don’t get overwhelmed—take it slow and steady. Remember to have fun with it; your house is going to look great!
