Are you thinking about selling your home in the next two to three years? If so, we have something of value for you today. One of the best times to sell your home in the Twin Cities area is during the spring market, which starts in the middle of February and runs through early June. The challenge with this is that your yard and outdoor spaces might not look so great during that time of year.&nbsp;

To help with this, **we're offering to have our professional photographer get exterior photos of your home this summer.** This benefit is provided with all John Schuster Group listings. We want to make sure your home can be shown in its best light no matter what time of year you decide to sell.&nbsp;

Reach out to us in the next 30 days to book your photo session. [Visit our website](https://johnschustergroup.com/) and click on the “Connect” button in the upper right-hand corner. Otherwise, you can call or text us at (952) 222-9000. We look forward to hearing from you!
