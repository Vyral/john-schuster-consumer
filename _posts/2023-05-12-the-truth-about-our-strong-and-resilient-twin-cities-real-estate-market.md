Over the previous nine months, we have felt the market shift. Closed sales are down 21.2% and new listings are down 24.1% from this time last year. Also, interest rates have nearly doubled. What does all of that mean?&nbsp;

**Fortunately, in the Twin Cities, our real estate market is strong and resilient.** We're seeing multiple offers come back again, and the inventory of available properties is at 1.4 months. Just know that a balanced market is between four and six months, so we’re far from that. However, we're seeing price gains on turnkey, well-maintained homes.&nbsp;
