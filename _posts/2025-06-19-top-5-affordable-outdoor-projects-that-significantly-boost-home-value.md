I’ve been speaking with a lot of homeowners, and I’ve noticed that they often ask me the same thing: “What outdoor projects will add value to my home?” Whether you’re considering selling or simply want to build equity, not all upgrades are worth the time and money. Some projects bring a strong return, while others just look nice. If you’re ready to invest in your property this season, here are five home improvements to consider.

**1\. Landscaping and tree planting.** Curb appeal starts with the yard. Planting trees, adding mulch, trimming overgrown shrubs, and creating clean garden beds can go a long way. These updates are affordable and make a strong first impression. Buyers often decide how they feel about a home before they even step inside, so this step matters.

**2\. Deck and patio additions.** An outdoor living space is a significant selling point. Adding or improving a deck or patio creates more usable space, encouraging buyers to envision relaxing or entertaining outside. Small additions like a fire pit or string lights can also help set the scene and make the area feel like an extension of the home.

**3\. Lawn care.** A green, healthy lawn instantly lifts the look of any home. Fertilizing, watering, and controlling weeds can bring most lawns back to life in one season. If your yard looks clean and cared for, it adds confidence to the overall property.

**4\. Garage door replacement.** A new garage door is one of the most overlooked but impactful upgrades. It adds curb appeal and often has one of the highest returns on investment. A modern door can give your entire home a refreshed appearance without requiring a significant renovation.

**5\. New or fresh exterior paint.** If your home has wood siding, it should be painted every 4 to 7 years. A clean, updated paint job helps your home stand out and look move-in ready. This is especially important when buyers are comparing homes in your neighborhood.

Focusing on these five areas can help increase your home’s value and make it more attractive to buyers.
