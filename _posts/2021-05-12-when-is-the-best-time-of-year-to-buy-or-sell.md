A question we’ve been getting a lot recently is, “When is the best time to buy or sell a home?” The great thing is that homes sell all year long and every month here in the Twin Cities, but the supply and demand tend to follow a specific pattern. **Knowing when to enter the market could cost or make you thousands.** Let’s take a walk through a typical year.

In January, many people start making their plans for the year. They start talking to agents and loan officers and listing activity starts. The spring market starts in February, usually right after the Super Bowl.

**Spring is when you’ll see most of the new listings come to the market** and the five strongest months of buyer activity. Our spring market starts in February and runs through June. Right around the Fourth of July, we see a slowdown of new listings and new buyers. This can continue into August, as families with school-aged children are gearing up for the new year, and everyone’s looking to enjoy their last bits of summer.

Many times we see a fall bump of new listings and buyers right after Labor Day. This continues through October. Then we go into our holiday market during November and December. The inventory is pretty light that time of year, but there are still active buyers and a lot of relocation buyers.

**Everyone’s wants and needs are different, and every situation is different.** Contact a trusted local agent today to put together a game plan that suits you.

If you have any questions or want to know how we can help you take advantage of the market this year, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
