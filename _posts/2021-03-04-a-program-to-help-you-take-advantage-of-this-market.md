<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how the Weekend Listing program can help you sell in this market.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

We have a low-inventory alert for the Twin Cities marketplace, and it’s something we’ve never seen before.

Get this: There is less than one month of supply available in the Twin Cities area. Experts say that a balanced market has a six-month supply of homes. Demand is drastically outpacing supply, and like the stock market, you want to buy low and sell high when it comes to real estate. This might be one of the best times in modern history to get a top-dollar offer for your home.

Markets are cyclical, and we’ve seen nine years of aggressive price appreciation. Markets can only go up so long before the pendulum swings in the other direction. Oftentimes, homeowners tell us they’d love to entertain offers for their homes, but they don’t want to go through the fuss of getting them ready for the market. We know this can be a lot of work, but because of our current market conditions, you might not have to put in as much work as you think.

This is precisely why we created the Weekend Listing—a program for homeowners who are truly interested in entertaining offers for their homes without spending months getting them ready for sale. With this program, you can have your house on the market in less than a week and be looking at offers in just seven days. It’s all the upside of enjoying this market without the fuss. So put the paintbrush down, forget about making all those updates, and hit the ‘easy’ button.

We’ll have offers for you to review in no time, and you can sell and close on terms that work for you. Contact us today for more details on this program. All inquiries will be kept fully confidential, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised to see the equity in your home.

In any case, if you’re even thinking of selling in the next 24 months, you should consider doing so now in this record-breaking market. If you want to see what your home can currently sell for, use the home estimate tool on our website. As always, if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
