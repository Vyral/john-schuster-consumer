In the current hot seller’s market, many people have been reaching out to ask for our help with their home sales. Today I’m answering the top three questions sellers ask us before we list their homes:

**1\. Why is it such a crazy seller’s market?** There are a few factors at play: very low interest rates, the lack of new construction over the last decade, millennials entering the real estate market in droves, and the pandemic. All this has led to an imbalance of supply and demand.&nbsp;

**2\. Is it better to sell as is or with updates?** Often in this market, expensive, time-consuming updates just aren’t needed to help you get the best price. Some updates make your home more showable and market-ready such as fresh paint, new carpet, and decluttering. These things bring you immediate and positive returns on your investment.&nbsp;

**3\. Should I sell this year or wait?** This is the million-dollar question. This is one of the best seller’s markets anyone on our team has ever seen. Markets are cyclical, so we have plenty of sellers listing now to secure top dollar, and some are even renting for a short time after they sell and waiting to buy until the market balances again.&nbsp;

If you’re considering selling your home within the next few years, you’ll want to think about selling in the present market. Again, all markets are cyclical, and what goes up must come back down.
