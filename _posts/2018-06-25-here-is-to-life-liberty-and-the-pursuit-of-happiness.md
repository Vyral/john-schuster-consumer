  Happy Fourth of July! On this day in our nation’s history, the founding
  fathers took some of the first steps toward what would become the American
  independence we enjoy today. And the rights they proclaimed on that day still
  ring true in this moment. So I hope that you enjoy this holiday with loved
  ones. To see my full message, watch this short video.

242 years ago this July 4, our Founding Fathers took the first steps in creating American independence. 

It is during times such as these that we should reflect on the famed, familiar words of Thomas Jefferson: **“We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal;** that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

This Fourth of July, we would like to encourage all of you to spend the holiday with family and friends in celebration of these values. Our team is so grateful for the bountiful opportunities provided to us as citizens of this great nation. And **we’re also grateful for all of you, our clients, and your continued support.** Happy Fourth of July!

As always, if you have any questions about real estate or would like to discuss your goals, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
