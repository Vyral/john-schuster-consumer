We bet you’ve been hearing about how crazy the market has been, but **the best time to buy will be over the next few months.** As we get into late fall and winter, buyers leave the market because many of them want to close between March and August. That means if you get in the market now, you’ll have less competition.

On top of that, some sellers are trying to price their homes at the elevated prices we saw last spring, and the market is saying no to these properties. We’re seeing a lot of price reductions, so **now is a good time to negotiate on a home and avoid competition with other buyers.**

There are fewer homes to choose from, but if you wait, you’ll have to deal with more competition. Be smart and know your market. If you’d like to see all of the homes on the MLS or know the current price of your home, contact us today on [our website](https://www.johnschustergroup.com/) or at 952-222-9000. Have a great day\!<br>
