  Spring is an incredible time for sellers. And while spring of 2019 may seem
  like a long ways off, it isn’t too soon to start preparing if you plan to list
  at that time. Why? Well, imagine you wait to take pictures of your home until
  right before the spring market reaches its peak. Grey, snowy conditions don’t
  make for great photos. It’s much better to capture photos of your property now
  while the landscape is still green. To learn more about why now is the time to
  prepare for your listing, watch this short video.

Spring is one of the best times to sell your home quickly and for top dollar. If you’re thinking of listing next spring, it isn’t too soon to start getting ready. The season may seem far off, but now is actually the perfect time to prepare. 

Why? Well, consider this: **Frost and snow from the winter and early spring months don’t do a lot of favors for your curb appeal.** If you wait to take pictures of your listing until right before you sell in the spring, you could be stuck with drab, grey photos. 

This is exactly why now is the time to prepare for your spring sale. Right now, our team is offering free photography and staging services to anyone looking to list this coming spring. And for sellers who live on an acreage or lake, we also offer drone filming services. **This way, you can capture photos and videos of your property while the landscape is still green** and the skies are still blue.
