We’re here today with a quick Twin Cities fall real estate market update for all of you. For the rolling 12 months through September 2019, new listings were slightly up by 1.3%, while closed sales were down by 0.5%. Inventory remains low after dropping by 5.8% and there is currently just a 2.5-month supply of homes available. This is great news for sellers, as is the fact that the average sale price is up by 8%. If you’re thinking of selling in 2020, now might be the perfect opportunity to take advantage of this seller’s market. The spring market is just around the corner, and we have a program that can get any home ready within three months. The time to take action on a spring sale is now.
