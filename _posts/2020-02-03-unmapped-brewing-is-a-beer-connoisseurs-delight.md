In today’s episode of our community spotlight series, we’re visiting Unmapped Brewing and speaking with owner JD Park.&nbsp;

When JD met his wife—A Minnetonka native—while in college, it was her goal to start her own business, and that mentality had a big influence on him. After they moved back to her hometown, they each got jobs they were happy with, but JD couldn’t shake the desire to start his own business.&nbsp;

JD was passionate about beer. He visited breweries all the time and was an avid homebrewer. **After raising the necessary funds and developing a business plan, he opened Unmapped Brewing in June 2017.** They only had two beers on tap when they started, but now they’re up to 13.&nbsp;

What are their top beers? The biggest seller, according to JD, is their No Trace IPA. Their Quadruplication Belgian quadruple and Topo Wit Belgian white ale are also very popular. Additionally, their Purgatory pilsner won “Best Lager” at the Minnesota Brewer’s Cup last year.

Taprooms are multiplying throughout the Twin Cities area and nationwide, **but Unmapped Brewing has thrived amidst competition thanks to their diverse selection of beers.** They try to keep the favorites on tap, but they cater to a wide variety of people. Not only are they family-friendly, but they’re dog-friendly, too. If you’re not a beer drinker, you don’t have to drink to enjoy your time at this establishment. They have food trucks that arrive all the time. In JD’s own words, they’re not a bar—they’re a gathering place.&nbsp;

So, if you’re ever in Minnetonka, we recommend visiting Unmapped Brewing. Also, [check out their website](http://unmappedbrewing.com/) if you’d like to know more about them.&nbsp;
