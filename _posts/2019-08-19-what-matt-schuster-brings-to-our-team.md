Matt Schuster has become one of the top agents at the John Schuster Group, and we’re excited to share his story for our latest agent spotlight.&nbsp;

Before he entered the real estate profession, Matt was a manager at Macy’s. According to him, the transition made sense because he owned investment properties and he wanted to help other people do the same.&nbsp;

Matt leads the team in five-star reviews, and his secret to giving awesome customer service is the fact that **he knows buying a house can be very stressful, so he focuses on reducing that stress and having some fun at the same time.&nbsp;**

Besides being a rockstar agent, Matt sponsors and plays both kickball and dodgeball for Stonewall Sports and has some big plans for the future—he’s taking a cruise\!

We love working with Matt, and if you want to work with him or you want to know more about our team, feel free to give us a call or message us on our website. We’d love to hear from you.
