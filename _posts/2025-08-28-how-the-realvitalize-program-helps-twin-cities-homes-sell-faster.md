One of the most common questions sellers ask is: *“Should I make updates before selling?”* It’s a fair concern. Strategic updates can help your home sell faster and for a higher price. Buyers are more likely to act quickly and offer top dollar on a home that looks move-in ready. But the challenge lies in balancing time, cost, and knowing which improvements actually matter to buyers.

**That’s where the** [Coldwell Banker Exclusive RealVitalize Program](https://coldwellbankerelite.com/realvitalize) **comes in.** This program takes the stress out of pre-sale improvements by fronting the costs for you. That means you can refresh your home without paying anything until closing. Here’s how the RealVitalize Program works:
