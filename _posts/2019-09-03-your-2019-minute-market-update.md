Welcome back\! Here’s a quick update on the latest developments from our market area.

Through the end of July 2019, new listings dropped slightly by 0.6%, closed sales were down by 1.4%, and inventory levels were down 4.4%, leaving us with only 2.4 months of supply on average throughout all price points.

**The great news for sellers is that the average sales price rose by 5.5% and interest rates dropped by almost a full 1% over the last year\!**

If you’re thinking of selling your home, doing so now or in the near future could be a great opportunity for you to take advantage of our current conditions while we remain in a seller’s market.

If you’d like to know what your home would sell for in the market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We hope to connect with you soon\!<br>&nbsp;
