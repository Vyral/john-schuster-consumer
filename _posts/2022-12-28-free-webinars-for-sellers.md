With higher inflation, interest rates, and wildly shifting prices, the real estate market is pretty crazy right now. If you’re thinking about selling your home, it’s more important than ever to understand what this environment means for you. That’s why we are going to be offering four free virtual home seller forums at the end of the month. It’s easy to attend these fun webinars. **There’s no charge and no obligation,** and they last just under an hour.

Some of the key things we’ll be covering will be where the market has been and where we think we’re heading, as well as five things that sellers can do to maximize their equity, and we’ll even touch on marketing that works. Finally, we’ll be covering five mistakes that sellers should avoid, and answering all of your questions.

There will be a maximum number of attendees, so make sure to register now at our [website](https://johnschustergroup.com/home_seller_forum){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. We’ll be holding these seminars on Tuesday, January 31, at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. and on Thursday, February 2, at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. **When you register, you’ll get a free copy of John’s 40-page whole marketing guide.**

If you have any questions about the event or anything that’s real estate related, call or email us. We’re always happy to help!
