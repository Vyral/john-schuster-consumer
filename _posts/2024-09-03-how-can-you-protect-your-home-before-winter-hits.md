Winter is coming, and with it, cold winds and snow. If your home isn’t prepared, those chilly days could lead to big problems, but getting your home ready for winter doesn’t have to be difficult. With just a few easy steps, you can keep your home warm and safe all season long. Here are five simple tips to help you get started.

First, **make sure your furnace or boiler is ready.** Before winter hits, call an HVAC contractor to check your furnace. You don’t want it to break down when you need it most. And while you’re at it, don’t forget to change your furnace filters. ** ** Clean filters keep your air fresh and help your heating system run smoothly, which can save you money on heating bills.

**Next, clean out your gutters and downspouts.** Fallen leaves can clog your gutters, trapping water that can freeze and cause damage to your roof and walls. Taking a little time to clear them out now will help you avoid bigger problems later.

After that, **winterize your outdoor spigots and irrigation systems.** In Minnesota, snow can arrive as early as October, so it’s important to take care of this before the first freeze. If you don’t, you might end up with burst pipes and expensive repairs. A little work now can save you a lot of trouble later.

Don’t forget to test your carbon monoxide and smoke detectors. It’s not just your furnace that needs attention, but your safety devices too. Make sure all your detectors are working, especially near bedrooms, the kitchen, and the basement. This quick check could keep your family safe all winter.

Finally, **take care of your lawn by mulching leaves and adding fertilizer.** Even though winter is coming, your lawn still needs care. Mulching and fertilizing will help keep it healthy through the cold months, so when spring comes, you’ll have a green, beautiful yard.

Winter is just around the corner, but by following these simple steps, your home will be ready. If you’re thinking about selling your home soon, getting it winter-ready now can make a big difference. The spring market is one of the best times to sell, so it’s a good idea to start preparing early. Don’t let winter catch you by surprise. Get your home ready now and enjoy a worry-free season!
