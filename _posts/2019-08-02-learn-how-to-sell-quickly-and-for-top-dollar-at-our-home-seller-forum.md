Putting your home on the market can be a daunting task, which is why we want to invite you to our upcoming Home Seller Forum that John and Paul Douglas will be hosting.&nbsp; This is a free, no-obligation seminar that will teach you everything you need to know to sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

Here, you’ll learn:

* Five things you can do to maximize the value of your home
* Three pitfalls that will cost you thousands on your home sale

**The seminar will take place over the course of two days on September 11th and 12th and be split into two sessions each day—one at 11 a.m. and one at 6:45 p.m.** The first day we’ll be hosting it at the Maple Grove Community Center, and the second day we’ll be at the Eagan Community Center.&nbsp;

In just one hour, we’ll give you all the tools you need to make thousands more on your home sale. Not only that, but we’ll have a blast doing it.&nbsp;

Hundreds of sellers have benefited from this seminar, and our last two events sold out quickly, so time is limited if you wish to attend. **To register, all you need to do is[&nbsp;click on this link.&nbsp;](https://www.johnschustergroup.com/home_seller_forum)**

If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out. We would love to help you.&nbsp;
