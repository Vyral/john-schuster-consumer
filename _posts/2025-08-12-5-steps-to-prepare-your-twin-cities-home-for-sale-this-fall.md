If you are thinking of listing your home this fall or early winter, there are a few important steps you can take now to set yourself up for success. These can help you attract more buyers, secure stronger offers, and sell with less stress. Remember: the earlier you start, the more prepared you will be when it is time to go to market.

Over the years, I have seen how the right preparation can directly impact the success of a home sale. It is more than simply putting a sign in the yard. The goal is to present your home in a way that builds buyer confidence and creates excitement from the first showing. Here are the five things you should do now to help your home stand out:

**1\. Tidy up the landscaping**. The first impression a buyer gets when walking up to your home is important. From the moment they approach the front door, the condition of your yard sets the tone for the rest of the showing. Make sure your landscaping is clean and well-maintained so buyers see the property in its best light.

**2\. Service your HVAC, furnace, and fireplace**. Your heating and fireplace systems will soon be in heavy use. Schedule a tune-up now to ensure everything is running efficiently. Taking care of this ahead of time can prevent last-minute issues during the sale process.

**3\. Fix lingering issues.** Address any needed repairs while you still have time and before contractors become booked with other projects. Completing these fixes early can remove potential objections from buyers and help keep the sale moving forward.

**4\. Meet with a trusted and experienced agent**. An experienced agent can guide you through each step of selling your home. Meeting early allows you to create a clear plan, understand the market, and avoid unnecessary stress during the process.

**5\. Get nice exterior photos.** High-quality exterior photos are essential. Have them taken while your yard is looking its best, the grass is green, and the trees still have leaves. These photos can capture your home’s appeal and make a strong impression in online listings.

Know your home value. Knowing your home’s value is also an important step in planning a successful sale. It helps you set a competitive asking price, attract the right buyers, and position your property effectively in the market.
