I recently joined Jordana Green and Paul Douglas to talk about some things that you’ll need to do quickly if you’re thinking of selling your home next winter or spring.

**Great photography is so important if you’re looking to get top dollar for your home.** If you’re thinking of selling in Spring 2020, the time to act is now.&nbsp;

**Our team is offering you three things right now.** First, we’ll come out and get a free exterior photography package for your home. Additionally, we’re offering a free staging consultation and a free, no-obligation walk-through to put together a market analysis and a game plan for next year.

**I’ve done this for many clients in the past and it works.** Once we get into the fall and winter, those exterior photos aren’t going to be as good. However, if you get them taken right now, we can use them whenever you’re ready to list in the coming months.

If you'd like to take us up on our offer, visit our website or just give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
