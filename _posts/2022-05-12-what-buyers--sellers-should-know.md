What impact will rising interest rates have? These increases don't just affect real estate; they impact every aspect of the economy. We brought in our residential real estate mortgage expert Ali Reda to break it down.

We’ve seen a lot of movement with respect to interest rates in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipated rates to go up—just not this quickly. As a result, **buyers will lose quite a bit of their purchasing power.** Now buyers are paying more for houses that would have cost much less just a few months ago.

Likely, buyers are going to slow down their activities and weigh their options. Some of them might even exit the market temporarily. In the long term, **this slowdown will create a more balanced market,** since the presence of fewer buyers will increase available inventory.

If you’d like to get pre-approved for a new home or refinance your current home, contact Ali directly at (612) 940-6722 or by visiting <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.envoymortgage.com/loan-officer/ali-reda-edina-mn/">his website</a></u>. If you’re looking to buy or sell a home, give the John Schuster Group a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you get going.
