I recently had some time to visit with Jordana and Paul of WCCO News Radio. The other day, someone called into their show and told them they were so happy because they just sold their home with me. They thought it was a plant, but truthfully, I had no idea. It was great to hear that people are happy to be working with us, though. To whoever it was that called in: I’m happy that you’re happy. Thanks for spreading the word.
