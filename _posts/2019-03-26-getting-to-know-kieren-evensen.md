Today I'm happy to be joined by team member Kieren Evensen to pick his brain about his business, some of his hobbies, and his thoughts on the state of our current real estate market. So far in 2019, he’s been absolutely on fire—as of the first week of March, he’d already sold eight listings!

As a resident of Minneapolis, Kieren loves hiking, biking, and jogging around the lakes—in fact, he used to be a regular marathoner. He also loves to cook, and during the summer, you can find him grilling outside almost every single day.&nbsp;

What’s his take on our current market? He says that **although the weather slowed activity down a bit this year, there are a lot of sellers out there ready to list their homes**. We’re also seeing some pretty aggressive buyers—especially first-time buyers.&nbsp;

We’re blessed to have Kieren on our team, so if you’re thinking of buying or selling a property, give him a call and we guarantee he’ll take care of all your real estate needs.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
