We’re excited to announce our newest office\! Part of the Minnesota dream is owning a cabin. The great thing about living in the Twin Cities is that you can easily drive to cabin country. The Brainerd Lakes area is only a few hours away.

More and more, we’re seeing our clients want to purchase or sell a Central-Minnesota lakefront home. The new Coldwell Banker Realty Brainerd Lakes Office is located in Cross Lake. If you’re looking to purchase a cabin on Whitefish Lake, the Cross Lake chain, the Gull Lake chain, Pelican Lake, Bay Lake, Mille-Lacs Lake, or any of the hundreds of smaller surrounding lakes, we can help you out.

Think of the lifelong memories you’ll make with your family and friends at your new lakefront cabin. Better yet, purchase your dream cabin and then consider renting it out as a short-term rental. I know many people who can pay all their cabin expenses by renting out their cabin for six to eight weeks per year.
