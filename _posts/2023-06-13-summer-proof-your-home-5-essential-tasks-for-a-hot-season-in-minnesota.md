Before you hit the lake and enjoy the summer in Minnesota, here are five essential tasks you need to do to prepare your home for the hot weather:

**1\. Clean out your gutters and downspouts**. This ensures that the downspouts extend at least ten feet away from your house to prevent water damage.

**2\. Check your foundation.** Seal any cracks. Make sure the earth around your home slopes away from your property. Correct any issues promptly to avoid water seepage into your basement.

**3\. Repair and reseal all your woodwork.** This includes decks, fences, railings, siding, and trim. Unsealed wood is prone to rot, and wood staining is usually required every two years.

**4\. Have your air conditioner tuned up by an HVAC contractor.** It's recommended to do this every two years to ensure its optimal performance.

**5\. Reverse the direction of your ceiling fans**. Have it rotate counterclockwise for summer. Take the opportunity to clean the fan blades as well.
