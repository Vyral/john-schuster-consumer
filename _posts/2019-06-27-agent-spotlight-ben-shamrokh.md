We’re continuing our Agent Spotlight Series today with rockstar agent Ben Shamrokh.

Ben was born and raised here in the Twin Cities and has lived here all his life. **His dad was a driving force behind his career in real estate** and worked as a real estate broker before him. Now Ben has followed in his footsteps.

He showed him that real estate was a tool to invest and really enjoyed working with his dad growing up.

He’s a professional sand volleyball player and has traveled around the country playing. In addition to all of that, Ben has a growing family of four fantastic girls and a lovely wife.

One thing you might not know about Ben is that his mom is from Thailand and his dad is from Egypt. **There’s not a lot of Thai Egyptians floating around, which makes Ben even that much more special and unique.**

He’s an absolute rockstar and if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email today and we’ll be happy to get you connected with him. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
