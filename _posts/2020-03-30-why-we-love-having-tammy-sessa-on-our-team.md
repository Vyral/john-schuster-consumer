In today’s episode of our Agent Spotlight series, we’re interviewing Tammy Sessa.&nbsp;

Tammy is a great salesperson, and we love having her on our team. She just hit it out of the park with a huge sale, and she has many more deals coming down the pipeline.&nbsp;

Outside of real estate, Tammy spends most of her free time watching her son play hockey, which means a lot of drive time between rinks. One thing most people don’t know about her is she’s an avid beach volleyball player. She’s been playing for about 25 years and used to play professionally in Florida.&nbsp;

**Now for a little lightning round Q&A:**

* Ocean or mountain? “Ocean.”
* Day or night? “Night.”&nbsp;
* Comedy or horror? “Comedy.” (Not surprising considering there’s *someone* in our office—\*cough\* Matt—who likes to occasionally pop up out of nowhere and scare her, and she screams like bloody murder each time. 👻)
* Breakfast or dinner? “Dinner.”
* Passenger or driver? “Driver.”

If you’d like to know what your home is worth or want to get in touch with Tammy, don’t hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
