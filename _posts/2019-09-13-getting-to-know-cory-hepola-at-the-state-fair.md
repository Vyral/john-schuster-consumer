We loved watching WCCO Radio host Cory Hepola when he was the weekend anchor at KARE TV with his wife Camille, and we’re excited to have had him join us for a quick interview at the Minnesota State Fair.&nbsp;

How did Cory and his wife meet? He saw her on TV and decided he had to meet her, so he emailed her and they set up a date. On the day the date was supposed to happen, though, she canceled. So he emailed her again and they set up another date. However, she ended up canceling once again. The last time he asked, though, the third time ended up being a charm. They’ve been together ever since.&nbsp;

Cory’s a devoted family man, but when he found out he and his wife were having twins just 10 months after they had their first child, the news was a surprise, to say the least. “My soul exited my body,” he says, “and all I could see was, like, college and expenses, and now it’s amazing because I can’t imagine life without all three of them.”

A big turning point in Cory’s life happened when he was cut from his 8th grade basketball team. He was initially devastated, but his father and his coaches challenged him to change his attitude and be the best person he could be. By the time he was a senior, he was voted MVP of the Heart of the Lakes conference. **The lesson he took was that we can do anything we want if we have the right attitude and put our minds to it.&nbsp;**

How did he become such a great public speaker? His parents were active in their local church when he was growing up, and they encouraged him to do some of the readings during the service. He was nervous at first, but he did it, and it was a great source of inspiration for his current career.&nbsp;

**After covering these topics, we engaged in a lightning round Q&A session:**

* Cheese curds or Sweet Martha’s cookies? Cheese curds&nbsp;
* Who serves the better Jucy Lucy: Matt’s Bar or the 5-8 Club? Matt’s Bar

* What’s your favorite day of the week? Friday
* What’s the last song you downloaded? “Truth Hurts” by Lizzo&nbsp;
* What’s your favorite holiday? Christmas

* Would you rather have a big party or small gathering? Small gathering&nbsp;

Cory is a huge Minnesota Vikings fan, and he’ll be hosting his own Facebook Live session for every game this year that we highly recommend you check out if you’re a fellow Vikings fan. He was also nice enough to give us a shout out before we parted ways.&nbsp;

“I love John’s work. He’s the only agent I’d call if I needed to sell my home, so when we’re ready, we’re calling the John Schuster Group.”

On that note, we want to thank Cory for joining us and remind you that if you ever have any real estate needs at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.&nbsp;
