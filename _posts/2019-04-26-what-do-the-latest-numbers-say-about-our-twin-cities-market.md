The spring market has finally arrived, and it’s here in full force. 

According to the year-over-year numbers from March, the average sale price has increased by 5.6% to $316,000. There is fierce competition for homes in certain price points, and the average list-to-sale price ratio has risen 0.4% to 98.9%. Additionally, the average days on market for listed homes has decreased 9.4% to 48 days. 

If you’re a buyer, this means you want to enter this market with a full pre-approval from your lender and you want to have a networked agent by your side. It would be a bonus if your agent could find homes that aren’t even on the market yet (aka “pocket listings”).

If you’re a seller, it’s not a question of if your home will sell, but whether it will sell for the most money possible. As with buyers, you need to work with an experienced, networked agent who can come up with a great marketing plan for your home.
