We have another home seller forum coming up, and you’re cordially invited to learn everything you need to know to boost your home sale by thousands of dollars.&nbsp;

Due to COVID-19,&nbsp;**this forum will be hosted virtually via a****&nbsp;webinar.**&nbsp;Paul Douglas will once again be moderating, and along with sharing our secrets to taking advantage of this market, we’ll also send you a free copy of our 40-page marketing guide.

In just one hour, you’ll get all the information you need to have a detailed gameplan when you’re ready to sell. This forum will be held over five sessions on the following dates:

* **Tuesday, September 15 at 11 a.m. or 6 p.m.**
* **Thursday, September 17 at 11 a.m. or 6 p.m.**
* **Saturday, September 19 at 11 a.m.**

As you know, each webinar hosts a limited number of people and they sell out quickly, so **sign up today by visiting&nbsp;[johnschustergroup.com](https://johnschustergroup.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** and clicking on the “Home Seller Forum” banner at the top of the page.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to call or email us. We’d love to speak with you, and we look forward to seeing you there\!&nbsp;
