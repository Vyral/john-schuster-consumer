It’s amazing the impact that having a quality real estate team on your side can have. To illustrate this, I recently brought on Paul Douglas and Jordana Green from WCCO Radio—two friends and past clients of mine to talk about their experience working with the John Schuster Group.&nbsp;

**According to Paul, the decision to work with us not only solved his real estate needs, but also resolved some marital tension.** Before partnering with the John Schuster Group, Paul and his wife were working with another agent. Unfortunately, this agent did a poor job. Things just weren’t working out.&nbsp;

The uncertainty and ambiguity they faced while working with this agent created so much stress that the experience began to put a strain on their relationship. Thankfully, as I mentioned before, all was resolved when they turned to us for help. We were able to successfully guide them through their transaction and, as a result, help reduce the tension that had grown in their marriage.&nbsp;

Jordana had a similar story to share. She had also listed with another agent before coming to our team for help, and, like Paul, found that things just weren’t working out. Worse still, the agent wouldn’t let her out of the contract—leaving her to suffer for six months with no offers on her home.&nbsp;

**When the six-month contract was up, Jordana decided to come to the John Schuster Group.** Her experience with us couldn’t have been more different from what she faced with her previous agent. She received multiple offers almost immediately and within just three weeks was under contract with a great buyer.

Our team is so happy to have been able to help Paul and Jordana, and theirs are just two of the many success stories we help create all the time. We are constantly striving to help people just like them meet and exceed their real estate goals. Part of the way we do this is by hosting educational events like the Home Seller Forum we held last September, where sellers had the chance to learn about the resources and techniques necessary to succeed in our market.&nbsp;

Over 120 people showed up to that event, so we’ve decided to host a few more. If you’re looking to learn how to maximize your home selling success, join us on either January 23 or January 24 at the Plymouth Community Center, or on January 26 at the Braemar Golf Course.&nbsp;

**Space is limited, so don’t delay in reserving your spot. You can register [here](http://www.johnschustergroup.com/home-seller-forum.php){: target="_blank"} for the date and time that works best for you.&nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
