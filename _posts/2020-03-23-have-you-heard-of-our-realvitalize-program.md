We’re joined today by Matt Baker, president of Coldwell Banker Burnet. He’s a rockstar and a Twin Cities real estate icon.

The reason Matt has joined us today? Coldwell Banker just rolled out a fabulous new program called RealVitalize. One thing that really overwhelms home sellers is all of the different things they can do to enhance their home’s value and make sure they don’t leave money on the table.&nbsp;

They want to make repairs, but many don’t know who should do them or how they will pay for them. **With this program, we’ll help you make the repairs without taking a dime out of your pocket until the home is actually closed.&nbsp;**

Matt also humored us by playing our little lightning round question game. Here are his answers:

* "Dog or cat?" *Dog*
* "Minneapolis or St. Paul?" *No comment&nbsp;*
* "Uptown or Downtown?" *Downtown*
* "Lake or ocean?"&nbsp;*Lake*
* "HGTV or This Old House?"&nbsp;*HGTV*
* "If you had one superpower what would it be?"&nbsp;*Flying*

Thanks so much to Matt for taking time out of his busy schedule to join us. If you want to know more about the RealVitalize program, **you can learn more here.** If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
