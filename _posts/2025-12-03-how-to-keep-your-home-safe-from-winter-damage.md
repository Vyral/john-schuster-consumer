Your home has its own way of communicating, especially in winter. When cold weather sets in, your home can start sharing clues through new and unexpected sounds. Some noises are simply part of the season, but others point to issues that deserve attention.

Understanding what these sounds mean helps you know when to relax and when to take action.

**A rattling furnace may indicate a system problem.** Loud bangs or pops often happen when ductwork expands and contracts as the furnace kicks in. Most of the time, this sound is typical. The noises that matter are persistent clanking or rattling. If those continue, your HVAC system may need service.

**Winter dryness makes wood contract and creak.** Cold, dry air can cause wood to contract, leading to creaky floors or walls. That is a common winter occurrence. If you start hearing new cracking or shifting, it may be worth checking for structural issues or foundation movement.

**Water sounds in the walls need immediate attention.** Dripping or running water sounds inside your walls is a serious sign. In winter, this can mean frozen or burst pipes. It is something you want to catch immediately.

Your home will talk to you in winter. Some noises are seasonal, while others may be warning signs. Not sure what you’re hearing? We can help by having a professional take a look.
