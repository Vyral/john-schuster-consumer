We are so excited to announce that Mike Favre has joined our team. Let’s quickly put him through the lighting round now to get to know him better:

**1\. What got him into real estate?** He comes from a real estate background. It’s something he has been around his whole life, and he always kind of knew he’d go this route.

**2\. What brought him to Minnesota?** It’s close enough to home but far enough away. For example, all the outdoorsy things he loves about Wisconsin are still in Minnesota. At the end of the day, though, he’s a Pack fan.

**3\. What does he love about real estate?** The client-facing aspect of it and helping clients with the biggest transaction of their life. He loves to see their eyes light up at the closing table and thinks it’s a pretty cool feeling.

**4\. What does he do for fun?** He loves to travel and see new places. He loves the outdoors, camping, football in the fall, and the Midwest in general.

**5\. If he could be a superhero, who would he be?** It’s kind of cliche, but he’d have to go with Superman. Superman can do it all.

Thanks to Mike for taking some time to introduce himself. If you have any questions for us about our team, the market, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
