We’re here today to shine a light on a wonderful lender we love working with, Ali Reda. Recently, we bought a property, and out of three lenders we consulted, Ali had the lowest rate by far and was the most fun to work with.&nbsp;

Anyone who’s had the pleasure of working with Ali knows he’s stellar at what he does, but here’s something most people don’t know about him: He’s a tri-citizen—his parents were born in Egypt (making him an Egyptian national by default), he was actually born in Toronto, and he now lives and works in the U.S.&nbsp;

Keeping track of three different passports can be challenging, but at least he doesn’t have to file taxes in three separate nations\!&nbsp;

What does Ali expect to see in the mortgage business in 2020? **We’ve been in a low-rate environment for quite some time now**, and he says that **several signs actually point to a continuation of that.**&nbsp;

When you couple these low rates with rising values, it paints a vibrant picture in the world of lending; many will enter the market this year, and many more will find conditions favorable for a refinance.&nbsp;

Here’s an example that illustrates Ali’s expertise: Recently, a veteran whose home purchase we helped with four years ago was exploring a refinance, among other financial options. Initially, he approached Ali about getting a lower rate. Upon reviewing his full financial portfolio, Ali found a lot of looming debt scattered around, which caused this client to pay a ton in interest across the board.&nbsp;

Ali helped the vet utilize a VA loan to consolidate all of his debt, ultimately **saving him over $1,000 a month.** Prior to meeting with Ali, this man was set to pay his home off in 22 years; Ali took him down to 10 years—with the same payment.&nbsp;

Clearly, this lender knows what he’s doing\! But how will he fare in our lightning round? Here’s Ali’s answers:&nbsp;

* **Music or podcast?&nbsp;***Podcast. 888-Barbara is always a good one.&nbsp;*
* **Iced coffee or hot coffee?** *Actually, no coffee…* (absolutely crazy, considering that Ali gets up just before 5 a.m. and works out at 5:30).&nbsp;
* **Movies at home or movies at the theater?&nbsp;***At home, if I’m with my little man. Otherwise, I like the theater experience.&nbsp;*
* **Mornings or evenings?** *Definitely a morning guy.&nbsp;*
* **Football or baseball?** *Football.&nbsp;*
