Have you ever heard the story of the John Schuster Group? Whether you have worked with us many times before or you’re still trying to decide if you want to choose us, you should know our story and what’s important to us.&nbsp;

The John Schuster Group is led by John Schuster. His father and grandfather both worked as Realtors, and he knew he wanted that career path too! He has taken that passion for the business and created a team of 17 full-time agents who all work extremely hard for their clients.&nbsp;

**This team values the needs and desires of its clients more than anything else.** We get so much joy from seeing someone achieve their dreams, and it’s much more about that than the numbers or statistics. If you decide to work with the John Schuster Group, know that you will be well cared for, whether you’re dealing with a $200,000 house or a $600,000 house.&nbsp;

If you want to hear more about our values and core beliefs, and if you want to hear testimonies from clients as well as members of the group, please watch the video above. It will help you truly understand what we’re all about. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone call or email. We hope to hear from you soon!
