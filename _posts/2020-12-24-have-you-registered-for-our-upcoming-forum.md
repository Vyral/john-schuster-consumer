Paul Douglas is with us once again to talk about an exciting upcoming event that we’re hosting. The Twin Cities market is still red-hot and the best time to sell each year is in spring. It’s only a few months away, so that means it’s time for another Home Seller Forum to help area homeowners get their properties ready to sell for top dollar in 2021.

We’re super excited for Paul to moderate another one of these events. **Because of COVID, we’ll be hosting this forum like we did the last, virtually on Zoom.** When you sign up and log on, you'll learn everything you need to know to make thousands more on your home sale. We’ll share (almost) all of our marketing secrets and you’ll get a free copy of our 40-page home marketing guide.&nbsp;

**Each event lasts about 45 minutes and you'll leave the webinar with all the information you need to be fully informed with the right gameplan to make thousands more on your home sale.** We’ve helped many home sellers with this forum in the past, and we can’t wait to help even more.

There will be five of these seminars, with two each on January 19 and January 21. Here are the official dates and times:

* Tuesday, January 19 at 11 a.m.
* Tuesday, January 19 at 6 p.m.
* Thursday, January 21 at 11 a.m.
* Thursday, January 21 at 6 p.m.
* Saturday, January 23 at 11 a.m.

You can sign up for any of these Home Seller Forums [here.](https://www.johnschustergroup.com/home_seller_forum) We’re looking forward to seeing you there. If you have any questions about the seminar or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
