In today’s episode of our Agent Spotlight series, we’re featuring a great team member who has been with the John Schuster Group for 11 years now: Tim Lehman.&nbsp;

**Prior to coming to our team, Tim worked as a chef for several fantastic restaurants across the Twin Cities.** Even now that he’s made the switch to real estate, he still loves “playing chef” at home with his kids. And, of course, Tim’s family away from home (our team) also loves it when he brings in food for us.&nbsp;

But let’s get back to real estate. When asked why he likes working on a team, support and stability were the first two things Tim rattled off. And, as is evident by his incredible performance, the team environment we’ve cultivated here at the John Schuster Group has definitely allowed Tim to thrive.&nbsp;

**“We’re never left on our own,” says Tim. “We \[agents\] always have the support we need.”&nbsp;**

It was great to hear from Tim about how the support he’s received in his career has helped him to better serve buyers and sellers like you; but **if you’d like to learn even more about what Tim can do for your real estate goals, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.&nbsp;**

As always, we encourage you to give us a call or send us an email if you have any other questions or would like more information. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
