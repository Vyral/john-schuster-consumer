Thinking about selling your home but worried about costly repairs? What if you could sell for top dollar without spending anything upfront on renovations or staging? For the next month, we’re covering up to $50,000 in critical repairs and updates—no payment required until your home sells. This isn’t just about improving your home’s look; it’s about getting you the highest price when it hits the market.

We know that selling a home comes with its fair share of stress, and often, much of that stress comes from worrying about repairs, staging, and making your property stand out. That’s where we come in.

**First, we’ll send a professional, accredited home inspector to your property to assess any necessary repairs and improvements.** They’ll give you a “home health report,” which identifies the updates needed to make your home truly market-ready. Think of this as your roadmap to a smooth and profitable sale.

**Next, we’ll set you up with a top-tier home stager for a detailed consultation.** You’ll get expert advice on how to showcase your home’s best features, creating that “wow factor” that grabs buyers’ attention the moment they step through the door.

The good news is you won’t have to dip into your savings to cover the cost of repairs or updates. **Coldwell Banker will take care of up to $50,000 worth of expenses. Don’t worry**—**you won’t need to pay us back until your home sells.** This means you can focus on selling your home for the best possible price without worrying about draining your bank account.

From fresh paint and updated fixtures to necessary repairs, these upgrades can significantly increase your home’s market value, helping you sell faster and for more money. And the best part? We cover it upfront, giving you peace of mind.

This is an opportunity that could make a huge difference in how much you walk away with after selling your home. However, it won’t last forever—this special offer is only available for the next month. If you are interested, you can call or text me at **(952) 222-9000** to learn more and get started.
