We’re here today to give you a quick real estate market update as we head into spring. Our massive weekly snowstorms and polar vortexes have slowed the start to the typically hot spring market. **New listings for the week of Feb 23 were down 25%, while pending sales were down 12%.**

The great thing is that as we approach the spring market in earnest, the rolling average median sale price has risen by 7.3%, the average list price received is at 98.9%, and we’re just over a two-month supply of inventory. **If you’re a buyer, you want to enter this market pre-approved and working with a networked agent.** If you’re thinking of selling, this might be a great opportunity for you to take advantage of the spring market while it’s still a seller's market.
