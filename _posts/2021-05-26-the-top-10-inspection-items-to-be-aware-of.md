Most purchase agreements have a contingency clause for buyers to complete a full home inspection within a week of the agreement being signed by all parties. Today we’ll share the top 10 most common inspection items we see on a frequent basis.

If you’re even thinking of selling your home soon, it might make sense to keep these items in mind as you do a walk-through and make any necessary corrections before your home goes on the market. If you’re a buyer, we always recommend hiring a trusted, experienced professional to do a thorough inspection of your home before the purchase is complete and look for any issues these items might have created:

**1\. GFCI outlets.** You usually see these anywhere near water (the bathrooms, kitchen, outdoors, etc.), and they have breakers attached to them. Should the outlet get overloaded or come in contact with water, they shut it down before any major damage is done.&nbsp;

**2\. Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.** Make sure the home has them, they have fresh batteries in them, and they’re installed next to all sleeping areas.&nbsp;

**3\. Heating and cooling systems.** We’re talking about an annual tuneup, here—make sure you’re changing your furnace filters monthly, and have the systems cleaned and checked every year.&nbsp;

**4\. Windows.** How do the windows look? Do you have any that look frosted or like there’s water trapped inside them? If so you might have a broken window seal. You should also check your wood windows to see whether they need any sanding, painting, staining, or sealing. The sealant usually comes off at the bottom of the window frame, and you don’t want your windows to start rotting.&nbsp;

**5\. Handrails.** If you have a staircase going up or down that’s longer than two steps, make sure a hand railing is attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**6\. Ceilings.** Are there any stains on your ceiling? If so, you may need to check the plumbing or roof above that area.&nbsp;

**7\. Electrical panels.** Is the brand of your electrical panel a Federal Pacific panel? If so, you should have an electrician look at it immediately and get a bid for a replacement. A series of these panels failed in the past and were deemed a fire hazard. Many times, buyers will want these panels removed for safety reasons.&nbsp;

**8\. Window screens.** Do you have them? If so, where are they? If they’re not on your windows, they should be cleaned off and organized.&nbsp;

**9\. Gutters and downspouts.** Every spring and fall, you should make sure these are cleaned out. Your downspout extensions should also lead at least 10 feet away from the home. Most basement water issues derive from clogged gutters and missing downspouts.&nbsp;

**10\. Peeling paint.** If there’s any peeling paint inside or outside the home, scrape it off and repaint. Not only will this preserve the wood siding, but it will show that you care for your home and take care of normal maintenance items.&nbsp;
