  In case you didn’t know, The John Schuster Group was recently named the No. 1
  listing team for the entire state of Minnesota for Coldwell Banker. How did we
  do it? Today I’ll answer that question. To help me out, I’ve brought in my two
  good friends (and Twin Cities icons) Paul Douglas and Jordana Green of WCCO
  Radio to share their recent experiences listing with us. To find out how we
  sold their homes quickly and for top dollar, and how we can do the same for

\*As WCCO Radio’s Paul Douglas and Jordanna Green can attest, our comprehensive marketing strategy helps all of our clients sell their homes quickly and for top dollar. \*

Today I’m joined by Paul Douglas and Jordanna Green, the hosts of “The Paul & Jordanna Show” on WCCO Radio, to share some insight into how our group became the No. 1 listing team for the entire state of Minnesota for Coldwell Banker.

We love WCCO and their listeners. We’re lucky to have endorsements from people like Paul and Jordana; we recently had the privilege of selling both of their homes.

Jordana tried selling her home with another agent but didn’t have any luck. After she hired us, we sold her home in three weeks for more than its original listing price. Paul also tried selling his home with a previous agent, but nothing worked for him either. That’s when he hired our team and got almost instant results.

“We are believers,” Paul said. “You guys have figured out the formula. The marketing is out of this world.”

With that being said, our market is red-hot right now. Inventory is down 23% compared to last year, and many of our clients’ homes are selling with multiple offers. How do we get such consistent results from our listings?

A lot of it boils down to our **comprehensive marketing strategy.** Most of our clients aren’t ready to enter the market immediately, and it takes a while to get a listing ready. This is why we’ve mastered “coming soon” marketing. If we take on a listing that won’t be on the market for a month or two, we initiate our coming soon marketing plan to create a large pool of buyers for that house once it does hit the market. That’s how we generate multiple offers. By doing this, our clients sell faster and for more money. They’re happy, we’re happy, and our team is having a blast right now.

Another strategy we’ve implemented is **using pocket listings.** This is for sellers who don’t want to enter the MLS but would still sell for the right offer and perhaps want to test the market a little. In our low-inventory market, we’ve been getting fabulous offers for sellers with pocket listings. This way, we sell about 10% to 15% of our listings before they hit the market.

“I always tell people, unless you’re ready to move, don’t list with John, because he is going to sell that house,” Jordanna said. “If you call John, start packing, because that’s what’s going to happen for you.”

If you’re thinking of selling your home and you’d like to know what it would sell for, don’t hesitate to give us a call or shoot us an email so we can meet with you and give you a consultation.

I want to thank Paul and Jordanna for joining me today. Don’t forget to tune into WCCO from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, to catch the “The Paul & Jordanna Show.”

If you have any other questions or real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me anytime. I’d love to help you.
