The Twin Cities real estate market remains robust, with continuous price increases observed both year over year and month over month. Last year alone, the average sale price in the Twin Cities experienced a growth of 2.2%, reaching a little over $434,000. This upward trend underscores the enduring strength and resilience of the local real estate landscape.

With the current inventory standing at less than a two-month supply of homes on the market—a stark contrast to the 4 to 6-month supply indicative of a balanced market—we are squarely in a seller's market. **This discrepancy between demand and supply creates an opportune moment for homeowners to capitalize on their home equity.**
