Are you thinking of selling your home in the next 12 months? We have one simple tip that can earn you thousands of dollars more when you sell.

One of the best times to sell is during our spring market from February to May. The challenge is that it doesn’t always look so great outdoors at that time of year. **You should take green exterior photos right now to show off your home in its best light.** This will net you thousands of dollars more.

We will have our professional photographer capture amazing photos of the exterior of your home while it’s still green outside. **We only have about a month left to get those green exterior photos.** If you call and meet with us in the next two weeks, we can schedule to take your green exterior photos and give you a roadmap to get your home ready for the market. Go to [www.johnschustergroup.com](http://www.johnschustergroup.com) and click ‘Connect’ in the upper-right corner to let us know you want green exterior photos.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to us at (952) 222-9000. We’d love to hear from you and answer any questions.
