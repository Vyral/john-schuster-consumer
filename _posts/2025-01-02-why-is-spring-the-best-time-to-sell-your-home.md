Why is spring the best time to sell your home? With just a month to go, the Twin Cities’ spring real estate market is already picking up speed as buyers are getting ready to make their moves.

If the spring real estate market is new to you, you might be curious why buyers are more active this time of year. This is where we come in. Here are two reasons why this is the perfect time to sell your home and how you’re in a great position to make it happen.

**First, mortgage rates are dropping, buyers are taking advantage.** With mortgage rates continuing to drop, more buyers are able to afford homes. This means they’re likely to make offers on your property that could lead to a faster sale and a higher price for your home.

**Here’s how this surge in demand helps you.** As demand rises, the active search for homes creates an environment where your property is more likely to attract offers. That’s why it’s a good idea to get your home market-ready for spring as soon as possible and trust me, there’s a way to do it in just 30 to 60 days based on my experience. This surge in interest gives you a great chance to sell quickly and for the best price.
