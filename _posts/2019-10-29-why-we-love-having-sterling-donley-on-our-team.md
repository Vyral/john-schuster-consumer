For today’s agent spotlight, we are joined by ISA Sterling Donley. We’ve known Sterling for quite a long time, and we love having him on the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

As an inside sales agent, **he fields a lot of inbound calls and helps other agents put deals together.** For any incoming inquiries of potential buyers and sellers, his responsibility is to understand what their wants and needs are and then connect them to the right team member.&nbsp;

Sterling hails from South Minneapolis with his wife and two children. During the fall, they enjoy hiking and going to apple orchards, and during the summer, they like to go pontooning.&nbsp;

Now, for a little lightning-round Q&A:

* Cat or dog? Dog
* Sweets or carbs? Sweets
* Mac or PC? PC
* Dave Matthews Band or Phish? Dave Matthews Band
* Beach vacation or Colorado ski trip? Beach vacation

If you’d like to work with Sterling or you have any questions about our Twin Cities market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us or message us on our website. We look forward to hearing from you.
